# AI-Powered Spam Detection

The AI-Powered Spam Detection project is a machine learning solution designed to classify emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. By utilizing advanced techniques in natural language processing and machine learning, this project aims to provide an effective tool for filtering unwanted emails.

## Features

- **Spam Classification**: Accurately classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve over 95% accuracy in spam classification through fine-tuned model parameters.
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Minimize incorrect classifications to ensure the model's effectiveness in practical scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the model.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm and other machine learning techniques.
- **NLTK**: Toolkit for natural language processing and text vectorization.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing data and model performance.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess email data for training and evaluation.
2. **Vectorization**: Convert text data into numerical format using techniques such as TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training**: Develop and train a Naive Bayes model to classify emails based on their content.
4. **Performance Refinement**: Adjust model parameters to optimize accuracy and minimize false positives.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
